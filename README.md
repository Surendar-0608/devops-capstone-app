# DevOps Capstone Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Node.js web application.

The pipeline automates:

Source code integration using GitHub

Continuous Integration using Jenkins

Docker image build and push to Docker Hub

Automated deployment to AWS EC2

Infrastructure monitoring using Prometheus & Grafana

Log backup automation using shell scripting and cron jobs

The objective of this project is to implement a production-style DevOps workflow covering CI/CD, containerization, cloud deployment, monitoring, and automation.

Tech Stack:
- Git & GitHub
- Jenkins (Docker-based)
- Docker & Docker Hub
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
- Prometheus & Grafana
